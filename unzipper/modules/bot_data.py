**• How to extract 🤔**

    **1)** Send the file or link that you want to extract

**• How to change upload mode 🤔**
    Send **/mode**


**Note :**
    **1.** If your archive is password protected select `🔐` button
    **2.** Please don't send corrupted files ! If you sent one by mistake just send **/clean**
    **3.** If your archive have +95 files in it then bot can't show all of extracted files to select from (yet). So in that case if you can't see your file in the buttons just click on `Upload all 📤` button. It will send all extracted files to you !
